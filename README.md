# Packet-Level Cryptomining Network Traffic Dataset

## Regulations for data collection

- For each collected pcap, we need to have a csv record to describe the original file. The pcap file's name and the csv record's ID should be the same. The format of the csv record is described below:
   
    ```
    ID, echo_ts, computer_config, is_complete, encrypted, hash_rate_1, hash_rate_2, hash_rate_3, submission_rate, coin_type, minig_software, algo
    ``` 
    1. __id__: this ID string is generated by `id.py` in the `id_generator` folder.
    2. __echo_ts__: this field is a timestamp. When modifying the csv, just check the system timestamp and record it. You can use this command in Unix to check the timestamp: ```date '+%s'```.
    3. __computer_config__: describe the computer configuration used for mining. Only describe the hardware and software that has been utilized, for example, if you only used CPU to mine, then just add your CPU spec. Please specify if you configed some special settings such as memory limitations for core number limitations. (`sysctl machdep.cpu.brand_string`)
    5. __is_complete__: should be either `yes` or `no`. Answer `yes` if the traffic contains three-way handshaking and FIN. Otherwise, `no`.
    6. __encrypted__: should be either `yes` or `no`. Answer `yes` if the traffic is encrypted. Otherwise, `no`.
    7. __hash_rate_1__: the hash rate in 10 seconds. The example below is from CPU-xmrig. In this case, `707.1` should be filled in this field.
        ```
        [2020-01-21 13:46:33.954] speed 10s/60s/15m 707.1 772.9 753 H/s max 994.1 H/s
        ```
    8. __hash_rate_2__: the hash rate in 60 seconds.
    9. __hash_rate_3__: the hash rate in 15 minutes.
    10. __submission_rate__: the number of accepted/rejected results. From the example below, `13/0` should be filled in this field.
        ```
        [2020-01-21 13:46:30.507] accepted (13/0) diff 16384 (610 ms)
        ```
    11. __coin_type__: the type of coin in abbreviation (e.g., `xmr`).
    12. __minig_software__: the mining software you used (e.g., `xmrig`).
    13. __algo__: the algorithms used to do the mining, somtimes `auto`.
