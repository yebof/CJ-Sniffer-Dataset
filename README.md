# Packet-Level Cryptomining Network Traffic Dataset

This dataset contains more than 550 hours' labelled, packet-level, cryptomining network traffic generated by both normal cryptomining and illegitimate cryptojacking activities. 

It is the dataset used in the manuscript #261 that submitted to ACSAC 2021. Information about the authors and how to cite the dataset will be available with the publication of our research paper. Please do not publish any research work based upon this dataset before the publication of our paper.

## Data Format
All the cryptomining network traffic are captured in `pcap` format, which means the dataset in packet-level, which contains both headers and payloads of cryptomining messages.
## Labelling Information

- For each collected `pcap` file, we have an entry in the `labels.csv` file to describe its labelling information. The `pcap` file and the corresponding labelling entry are indexed with the same __id__.
- All the entries in the `labels.csv` file follow the same format, with 14 attributes. All the attributes in the `labels.csv` file are described below:
   
    ```
    ID, timestamp, mining_device_config, is_complete, encrypted, hash_rate_1, hash_rate_2, hash_rate_3, submission_number, coin_type, minig_software, algo, whether_cryptojacking, length
    ``` 
    1. __id__: the id of the `pcap` file that this entry describes.
    2. __timestamp__: this field is the timestamp that the mining traffic was cauptured.
    3. __mining_device_config__: describe the computer configuration used for mining. It only contains the hardware that has been utilized. For example, if the miner only uses CPU to mine, then it only records the CPU spec, without the GPU spec.
    4. __is_complete__: should be either `yes` or `no`. Answer `yes` if the traffic contains the registration and logout packets of pool mining. Otherwise, `no`.
    5. __encrypted__: should be either `yes` or `no`. Answer `yes` if the traffic is encrypted. Otherwise, `no`.
    6. __hash_rate_1__: the average hash rate in the latest 10 seconds.
    7. __hash_rate_2__: the average hash rate in the latest 60 seconds.
    8. __hash_rate_3__: the average hash rate in the latest 15 minutes.
    9.  __submission_number__: the number of accepted resuults / the number of rejected results. For example, if the miner submitted 10 mining results and 2 were rejected by the mining pool, this field should be `10/2`
    10. __coin_type__: the type of coin mined in the mining network traffic, in abbreviation (e.g., `xmr`, `eth`, or `btc`).
    11. __minig_software__: the mining software used to conduct mining (e.g., `xmrig`).
    12. __algo__: the algorithms used to conduct mining.
    13. __whether_cryptojacking__: should be either `yes` or `no`. Answer `yes` if any portion of the collected cryptomining traffic is generated by cryptojacking. Otherwise, `no`.
    14. __length__: the length (s) of the collected cryptominig traffic.
